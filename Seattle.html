		For some reason I have always had the fascination with the PNW (Pacific North West). I'm not sure if it's because I love mountains and grunge music (I was an emo kid), or that I would be 5 hours by plane closer to Japan (AKA my family) but I jusst knew that my heart would be happy if I lived there. Fast forward to last year and I really enjoyed my time in the Seattle area. The weather wasn't that big of a deal, great food was everywhere, and the constant site of large mountains made me happy. <br> The food was great in the city of Seattle, but it did die down in the more country side suburbs about an hour out from Seattle, but this is expected. If you ever have the chance to visit, I would recommend just walking around the city of Seattle, it can get overwhelming with all of the hills, but that just means you're burning calories that need to be replenished with great food!
